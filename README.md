# 2020 Summer Olympics Dashboard

This project is a data analytics and visualization dashboard built using Power BI to showcase the medal distribution among countries during the **2020 Summer Olympics**.

## üìå Project Overview

I web scraped data from **Wikipedia**, specifically a table listing each country's **Gold**, **Silver**, **Bronze**, and **Total** medals. The data was then cleaned, transformed, and visualized in **Power BI** to create an interactive dashboard that provides key insights about the Olympics medal performance.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** ‚Äì for dashboard creation and data visualization
- **Power Query** ‚Äì for data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Web Scraping** ‚Äì extracted data using browser tools from Wikipedia

## Data Preprocessing

Data was cleaned and prepared using **Power Query** in Power BI:
- Removed unnecessary or total rows
- Handled and replaced null values
- Converted data types as needed
- Created new columns to calculate:
  - Gold Medal %
  - Silver Medal %
  - Bronze Medal %
  - Total Medal Share %

## Dashboard Features

- **KPIs**: Total Medals, Total Gold, Silver, Bronze, Countries with Medals
- **Bar Chart**: Top 5 countries by medal count
- **Pie Charts**: Medal distribution by type and top countries
- **Map**: Highlighting all countries that won medals

## Dataset Source

Data was scraped from:  
üåê [Wikipedia ‚Äì 2020 Summer Olympics Medal Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Summer_Olympics_medal_table)

## Insights Gained

- USA led the medal tally followed by China and ROC
- Clear view of how medals are distributed among top countries
- Percentage contribution of each medal type adds more analytical depth

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data Collection (Web Scraping)
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Power Query)
